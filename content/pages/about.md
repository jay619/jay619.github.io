Hi, I am <username>, current graduate student in Data Science @ Johns Hopkins Univeristy Whitting School of Engineering. Currently I work as a technology analyst for Infosys contracted at Morgan Stanley in New York! This is my first github page and I will try to use this to show case my projects or as a blog (PS I'm not much of a blogger!).

More information to come .... ;)
